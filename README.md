# Uifry - Landing page

### Assigned by: Batch System

This is a landing page of the company Uifry. I was assigned to design and developed this landing page using Next.js and tailwind CSS. I tried my best to convert the figma design to an interactive landing page.

## Features

- I used Next.js and tailwind css to build this project. I also used daisy UI to create the navbar, framer motion for animation, and react icon for icons.
- This landing page is responsive for mobile and desktop.
- I used framer motion to do some animation on the Hero and Testimonial section.
- As per instruction I implemented the smooth scrolling using tailwind css.
- Used flexbox and grid for layout.
- I also implemented the dark mode switching by using the next theme.
